# Welcome {-}

Welcome to my online book *A Bayesian Introduction to Fish Population Analysis*.  This is based in large part on material I developed while teaching (1991-2014) at NC State University. My hope is that the book will be a bridge between traditional fisheries analtytical methods and Bayesian approaches that offer many advantages in ecological modeling. The book might be useful as an upper-level undergraduate or early graduate text, or for a working fisheries biologist interested in a hands-on introduction to Bayesian methods. The format for the book follows that used in an excellent collection of books by Marc Kéry and colleagues; for example, @kéry.schaub_2011. I have benefited greatly from working through their material, but any errors are mine. I welcome *constructive* feedback so please contact me (email: jhightower@ncsu.edu) if you encounter errors or just see something that could be written more clearly.
